# Airline Chatbot - Intent Classification

## Project Overview

This project leverages **Sentence Transformers** for semantic understanding. The system allows a chatbot to:

* Understand the **meaning of sentences**, not just keywords
* Perform **intent classification**
* Enable **semantic search** for similar queries

The project uses a **Streamlit frontend**, **FastAPI backend**, and **MongoDB** for storage.

## Tech Stack

* **Python 3.10+**
* **Streamlit** ‚Äì Frontend UI
* **FastAPI** ‚Äì Backend API
* **MongoDB Atlas** ‚Äì Database
* **Sentence Transformers (SBERT)** ‚Äì ML Model

---

## Folder Structure

```
asapp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/       # FastAPI backend code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/      # Streamlit frontend code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
```

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/catherine621/asapp.git
cd asapp
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Setup

1. **MongoDB Atlas**:

   * Create a free cluster
   * Add your cluster URI in `backend/config.py` or `.env`

2. **Frontend**:

   * Ensure API endpoints in the frontend point to your backend

3. **ML Model**:

   * Preload Sentence Transformer model in backend code (`ml_model.py`)

---

## Running the Project

### Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
streamlit run app.py
```

### Access App

* Open browser at `http://localhost:8501`

---

## Notes

* Ensure **MongoDB URI** is correct
* Python 3.10+ recommended
* For large datasets, consider caching embeddings

Perfect! You can include this in your **README** under a **‚ÄúDemo / Example Usage‚Äù** section to show how your chatbot works with **multiple intents** and **irrelevant cases**. Here‚Äôs how you can add it:

Bot (Irrelevant): ü§î This seems unrelated to airline queries.
Was this classification correct? (yes/no): no
Enter correct intent(s), comma separated: dsnlfkwne
‚ùå Intent 'dsnlfkwne' is not recognized. It must be one of the predefined intents.

### ‚úÖ Key Features Highlighted in This Demo

* **Multiple intents handled** in a single query (e.g., ‚ÄúMissing Bag‚Äù + ‚ÄúFlight Status‚Äù)
* **Irrelevant queries** classified correctly (e.g., random text ‚Üí ‚ÄúIrrelevant‚Äù)
* **Dynamic feedback & updating**: When the user provides corrections, the **model updates embeddings**
* **Detailed responses** per intent, allowing the chatbot to answer multiple queries at once
